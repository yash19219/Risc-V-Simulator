# Risc 5 Simulator


# ASSEMBLER
C++ Program taking assembly code as input in the form of string and converting it in binary code Instruction of 32-bit and then storing it into a file "binary.txt". <br/>
Here is the referenced used for converting assembly code to binary is : https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/html/rvi.html#ebreak. <br/>
All conversion is based on formats present in RISC – V Reference Sheet available in Project. <br/>

# Test Cases
we have added many test cases  <br/>
user can take input from there

# Support
OUR PROGRAM IS ABLE TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:-

->	ADD             Addition <br/>
->	ADDI 		        Add Immediate <br/>
->	SUB 		Subtraction <br/>
->	LW 		Load word <br/>
->	SW 		Store Word <br/>
->	JALR 		Jump and Link Register <br/>
->	JAL 		Jump and Link  <br/>
->	BEQ 		Branch Equal to <br/>
->	BNE 		Branch Not equal to <br/>
->	BLT		Branch Less than <br/>
->	BGE 		Branch greater than equal <br/>
->	LUI 		Load Upper Immediate <br/>
->	AND 		AND <br/>
->	OR 		OR <br/>
->	XOR 		XOR <br/>
->	SLL 		Shift Logical left <br/>
->	SRA 		Shift Right Arithmetic <br/>


# Built With/ Concepts Used
•	C++ complier is required to run this program

# Built With/ Concepts Used
•	C ++      \
•	RISC – V (32-Bit Architecture)

# How to build program (In Compiler)
->	open ca.cpp and then run the file <br/>
->	input.txt will contain assembly code <br/>
->	binary.txt will contain all the instruction in 32-bit binary form <br/>
->	output.txt will contain the final output  <br/>
