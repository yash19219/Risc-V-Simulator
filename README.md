# Risc 5 Simulator


# ASSEMBLER
C++ Program taking assembly code as input in the form of string and converting it in binary code Instruction of 32-bit and then storing it into a file "binary.txt".
Here is the referenced used for converting assembly code to binary is : https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/html/rvi.html#ebreak.
All conversion is based on formats present in RISC – V Reference Sheet available in Project.

# Test Cases
we have added many test cases ,user can take input from there

# Support
OUR PROGRAM IS ABLE TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:-

->	ADD             Addition
->	ADDI 		Add Immediate
->	SUB 		Subtraction
->	LW 		Load word
->	SW 		Store Word
->	JALR 		Jump and Link Register
->	JAL 		Jump and Link
->	BEQ 		Branch Equal to
->	BNE 		Branch Not equal to
->	BLT		Branch Less than
->	BGE 		Branch greater than equal
->	LUI 		Load Upper Immediate
->	AND 		AND
->	OR 		OR
->	XOR 		XOR
->	SLL 		Shift Logical left
->	SRA 		Shift Right Arithmetic


# Built With/ Concepts Used
•	C++ complier is required to run this program

# Built With/ Concepts Used
•	C ++      \
•	RISC – V (32-Bit Architecture)

# How to build program (In Compiler)
->	open ca.cpp and then run the file
->	input.txt will contain assembly code
->	binary.txt will contain all the instruction in 32-bit binary form
->	output.txt will contain the final output
